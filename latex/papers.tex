\section{Papers}

Must read papers: \cite{wiprog}, \cite{Berardi2025ExtremeEdge}, \cite{dcoss}. 
Those are the fundamental papers that support your work. Especifically, \cite{wiprog} and \cite{Berardi2025ExtremeEdge} are well written papers and I highly suggest you to read them to understand how to correct structure a manuscript (introduciton, architecture, implementation and performance evaluation). Further, they are highly related to your work. The work \cite{dcoss} is not so well writen but was the one that inspired your work. \\


Surveys or Reviews are academic papers that summarizes and organizes recent research results in a compreensively way. It is a great way to understand a new reserach field, what are the main challegnes and what is already resolved. In the case of this paper, I suggest citing the follwoing: \cite{Sangeeta23} provides a review of the usage of webassembly for the edge-cloud continuum (read it!), \cite{Ray23} provides a review of webassembly for IoT (take a look to cehck if there is something interesing, but this is not mandatory), and \cite{Hoque2022} which discuss the potential of WebAssembly for Edge Computing (should read it, it is a magazine, so it is shorter). \\


You can cite \cite{Wallentowitz2022} to support the claim that WebAssembly an interesting candidate for Embedded Systems. Do not need to deeply read it, just scan it. Paper \cite{Borui22} follows the same line, it deploys WASM in constrained edge devices -- but this is overall a better paper. You can also just scanned it. \\

Gareth et. al \cite{Gareth2020} discuss the idea of distributing FaaS over the continuum (it not utilizes WASM). Also, paper \cite{Shihong23} discuss more a less the same topics. \\

Paper \cite{Kjorveziroski2023} goes on the orchestration of WASM in serveless computing. It is very related to your thesis. Take a look. \\

This paper \cite{Nakakaze24} should be cite when discussing the communication issues from edge-to-edge using WASM. Take a look how those guys did it. \\

When saying that WASM can be utilized as a container, cite \cite{10682874}. \\

WASM + K8 \cite{9978884}. \\

Use \cite{WASMSpec24} to cite WebAssembly. \\
